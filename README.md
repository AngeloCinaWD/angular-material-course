# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/angular-university/angular-material-course.git

    cd angular-material-course
    npm ci

Note: **We recommend using npm ci, instead of npm install**. This will ensure that you use the exact dependency versions set on package-lock.json, unlike npm install which might potentially change those versions.

# To Run the Development Backend Server

    npm run server

# To run the Development UI Server

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

Note: **make sure to use command npm start and not ng serve, as npm start adds a couple extra options that are needed for our project **
